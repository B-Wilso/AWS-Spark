# AWS Spark's MLlib
Set-up Apache Spark with a Hadoop Distributed File System on an AWS Cluster to perform a variety Machine Learning tasks with Sparkâ€™s custom library, MLlib, on the Iris Dataset. Converted dataset from csv to correct MLlib format, LIBSVM, to compute metrics for Mult-Label Classification algorithms of MLPs, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
